We  have created 3 scripts:
- script_length.sh to test the time execution variation when we increase the length of the pattern (for a fixed number of threads = 4)
- script_number.sh  to test the time execution variation when we increase the number of the patterns (for a fixed number of threads = 4)
- script.sh to analyse performance according to number of threads.
